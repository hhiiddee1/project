# Problem:
Income inequality has always been a problem around the world. a research of OESO shows
that the richest 10% of the Netherlands have 68% of all the money. great visualizations
of this problem are scare. there are a couple of organizations that fight poverty in
the netherlands. These organisatins could use a good visualation of the inequality of
income really well. That's why i'm going to make this visualization.
