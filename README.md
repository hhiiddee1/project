# Problem:
Income inequality has always been a problem around the world. a research of OESO shows
that the richest 10% of the Netherlands have 68% of all the money. great visualizations
of this problem are scare. there are a couple of organizations that fight poverty in 
the netherlands. These organisatins could use a good visualation of the inequality of
income really well. That's why i'm going to make this visualization.

### Comparison with simelar solutions:
https://jaspernaberman.github.io/Programming-Project/Scripts/HTML/visualizations.html
this visualization is simelar to my solution because it's also based on data of europe.
The map feature is a good way to repesent some data and make charts show. this doesn't
need much changing. The circle chart needs to change because the it only has to show the
that year. the barchart isn't very practical in my case because it show a period and
a line chart is more practical for that case.

### Diffeculties:
linking all components together
